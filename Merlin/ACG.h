/**
*   \class ACG
*
*	Additive number generator. This method is presented in Volume II
*	of The Art of Computer Programming by Knuth. I've coded the algorithm
*	and have added the extensions by Andres Nowatzyk of CMU to randomize
*	the result of algorithm M a bit	by using an LCG & a spatial
*	permutation table.
*
*	The version presented uses the same constants for the LCG that Andres
*	uses (chosen by trial & error). The spatial permutation table is
*	the same size (it's based on word size). This is for 32-bit words.
*
*	The *auxillary table* used by the LCG table varies in size, and
*	is chosen to be the smallest power of two which is larger than
*	twice the size of the state table.
