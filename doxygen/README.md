# Merlin Doxygen Generation

These instructions will (in the future) tell you how to generate your own `doxygen` files for `Merlin`

If you wish to view pre-generated documentation, see `generated-docs`

## Editing the Documentation

The main documentation file is under `Merlin/Documentation.cpp`

If you wish to familiarise yourself with `doxygen`, the [Doxygen website](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html) is a great place to start

To generate `doxygen` files, ensure you are in the `doxygen` directory, in which `Merlin.Doxyfile` is contained, then run `doxygen Merlin.Doxyfile`.
